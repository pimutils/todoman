Changelog
=========

This file contains a brief summary of new features and dependency changes or
releases, in reverse chronological order.

v3.4.0
------

* Add ``-r`` option to ``new`` to read description from ``stdin``.

v3.3.0
------

* New runtime dependency: ``click-log``.
* Drop support for Python 3.3, which has reached its end of life cycle.
* Add `--raw` flag to `edit`. This allows editing the raw icalendar file, but
  **only use this if you really know what you're doing**. There's a big risk of
  data loss, and this is considered a developer / expert feature!

v3.2.4
------

* Deploy new versions to PyPI using ``twine``. Travis doesn't seem to be
  working.

v3.2.3
------

* Tests should no longer fail with ``pyicu`` installed.
* Improved documentation regarding how to test locally.

v3.2.2
------

* Initial support for (bash) autocompletion.
* The location field is not printed as part of ``--porcelain``.

v3.2.1
------

* Fix start-up crash caused by click_log interface change.
* Dropped runtime dependency: ``click_log``.

v3.2.0
------

* Completing recurring todos now works as expected and does not make if
  disappear forever.

v3.1.0
------

* Last-modified fields of todos are now updated upon edition.
* Sequence numbers are now properly increased upon edition.
* Add new command ``todo cancel`` to cancel an existing todo without deleting
  it.
* Add a new setting ``default_command``.
* Replace ``--all`` and ``--done-only`` with  ``--status``, which allows
  fine-grained status filtering. Use ``--status ANY`` or ``--status COMPLETED``
  to obtain the same results as the previous flags.
* Rename ``--today`` flag to ``--startable``.
* Illegal start dates (eg: start dates that are not before the due date) are
  ignored and are removed when saving an edited todo.

v3.0.1
------

* Fix a crash for users upgrading from pre-v3.0.0, caused due to the cache's
  schema not being updated.

v3.0.0
------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add a ``today`` setting and flag to exclude todos that start in the future.
* Add the ``--humanize`` to show friendlier date times (eg: ``in 3 hours``).
* Drop ``--urgent`` and introduced ``--priority``, which allows fine-filtering
  by priority.
* Add support for times in due dates, new ``time_format`` setting.
* Use the system's date format as a default.
* Add list selector to the interactive editor.
* Add ``--start=[before|after] [DATE]`` option for ``list`` to only show
  todos starting before/after given date.
* Add flag "--done-only" to todo list. Displays only completed tasks.
* Make the output of move, delete, copy and flush consistent.
* Porcelain now outputs proper JSON, rather than one-JSON-per-line.
* Increment sequence number upon edits.
* Print a descriptive message when no lists are found.
* Add full support for locations.

Packaging changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New runtime dependency: ``tabulate``.
* New runtime dependency: ``humanize``.
* New supported python version: ``pypy3``.
* Include an alternative [much faster] entry point (aka "bin") which we
  recommend all downstream packagers use. Please see the :ref:`Notes for
  Packagers <notes-for-packagers>` documentation for further details.

v2.1.0
------

* The global ``--verbosity`` option has been introduced. It doesn't do much for
  now though, because we do not have many debug logging statements.
* New PyPI dependency ``click-log``.
* The ``--no-human-time`` flag is gone. Integrations/scripts might want to look
  at ``--porcelain`` as an alternative.
* Fix crash when running ``todo new``.
* Fixes some issues when filtering todos from different timezones.
* Attempt to create the cache file's directory if it does not exist.
* Fix crash when running ``--porcelain show``.
* Show ``id`` for todos everywhere (eg: including new, etc).
* Add the ``ctrl-s`` shortcut for saving in the interactive editor.

v2.0.2
------

* Fix a crash after editing or completing a todo.

v2.0.1
------

* Fix a packaging error.

v2.0.0
------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* New flag ``--porcelain`` for programmatic integrations to use. See the
  ``integrations`` section :doc:`here </usage>` for details.
* Implement a new :doc:`configuration option </configure>`: ``default_due``.
* The configuration file is now pre-emptively validated. Users will be warned
  of any inconsistencies.
* The ``list`` command has a new ``--due`` flag to filter tasks due soon.
* Todo ids are now persisted in a cache. They can be manually purged using
  ``flush``.

Packaging changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* New runtime dependency: configobj
* New runtime dependency: python-dateutil
* New test dependency: flake8-import-order.
