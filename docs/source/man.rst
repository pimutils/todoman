Description
-----------

Todoman is a simple, standards-based, cli todo (aka: task) manager. Todos are
stored into *icalendar* files, which means you can sync them via *CalDAV*
using, for example, *vdirsyncer*.

Usage
-----

.. include:: _usage.rst

Configuring
-----------

.. include:: _configure.rst

Caveats
-------

Support for the ``percent-completed`` attribute is incomplete. Todoman can only
mark todos as completed (100%), and will not reflect nor allow editing for
values for ``percent > 0 ^ percent < 100``.
